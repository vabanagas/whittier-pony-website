## About

Founded in 1987, Whittier Pony Baseball has become the largest competitive youth baseball programs in the area.  Last year we had over 700 players, ages 4-14 yrs, participate in our 2018 program.  We also offer a "Champions‚Äù division for families with special needs children and young adults (ages 4-21yrs.) Sargent's Sporting Goods is our sponsor for this program, as well as many volunteers from our community.
