title: 2020 Spring Baseball Registrations Have Opened - Register 24/7!

As always, please register early to take full advantage of our split payment option and avoid our waiting list.



We would also like to urge our team Managers to please register early. - By having our prospective managers register early, this allows us to register as many players, as possible, for each division.



We conduct player tryout evaluations in January and all registered players will be placed on a team. Shetland players do not tryout and will be contacted by a team in late January.



For our Pinto through Pony players, we conduct a team draft. Tryout evaluations give our managers a chance to see the kids before the draft. In the spirit of team parody, throughout our divisions, Whittier Pony has a strict player distribution policy. Only siblings are promised to be paired together, if playing in the same division, according to the 2020 PONY age key.



Whittier Pony Baseball is by far the largest PONY League in the PONY East Region, which includes the entire San Gabriel Valley. There are no residence boundaries to play PONY Baseball. We never have to inter-league with others, because we average 8-12 teams per division. Our membership continues to grow annually. Just for our current Fallball season, we have 32 teams participating, with nearly 400 players! This great turnout of players is nearly a 30% increase from last season. We expect another huge turnout for Spring Baseball 2020.



For any questions on our league, or PONY Baseball, please contact Glenn Costello at: playeragent@whittierpony.org



PLAY BALL!
